												One of the largest and busiest railway junctions, it is arguably the most important station on the Grand Chord. In fact Dhanbad is the junction at which the Grand Chord really diverges from the CIC section. CIC rail line starts from Dhanbad and ends at Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh.

												There used to be another railway line from Dhanbad connecting it to Jharia and Pathardih. The line used to intersect the CIC section, requiring a Diamond Crossing. Now that the line has been dis-mantled, the Diamond Crossing is no longer operational. Previously when there were much less trains from Ranchi and adjoining areas, Dhanbad along with Tatanagar railway station served as the main railway stations for the entire state of Jharkhand.

											<h2>Fact about Dhanbad</h2>
											<p class="tm-box-p">Dhanbad, Bihar, December 28, 1963
There is no authentic record to show how Dhanbad took its name. One of the popular theories is that, this area was famous for the growth of “Baid Dhan “ or Baid paddy . There are three kinds of paddy in the district - Baid, Kanali and Bahiyar.
Another far-fetched theory is that the name of Dhanbad is derived from Dhan, a Kolarian tribe that lived in this area. “Baid” has perhaps been taken from
the Urdu word “Abad” meaning occupied. Dhanbad may mean the place populated by “Dhan” a kolarian tribe or occupied by “Dhan” (paddy) in general.
The district was first known as Dhanbaid. It is believed that Mr. Luby, Indian Civil Services officer (still popular in Dhanbad because of the Luby Circular Road), was officially permitted to drop the letter i from baid.
</p>
											<p class="tm-box-p">The First Labour Statue of Asia was built in Dhanbad<br>Randhir Prasad Verma was an Indian police officer who died while trying to resist a robbery attempt in a bank in Dhanbad. He was posthumously awarded the gallantry award Ashoka Chakra. The Government of India also issued a Commemorative postage stamp in his honor in 2004.

He was born in 1952 in the village Jagatpur of Supaul district previously in Saharsa district of Bihar and studied at St. John's High School, Ranchi and Patna College. He joined the Indian Police Service in 1974. As a police officer he eliminated many criminal gangs.

While serving in Dhanbad as the Superintendent of Police he died while resisting robbery at Bank of India branch on 3 January 1991.

His widow Rita Verma later joined politics and was elected to Lok Sabha from BJP ticket. A Chowk "Randhir Verma Chowk" is a busy lane named after him in Dhanbad. His wife lives with two growing sons.In Muzaffarpur District there is a Cricket Club on the name Randhir Prasad Verma known as Randhir Verma Cricket Club (RVCC).</p>
